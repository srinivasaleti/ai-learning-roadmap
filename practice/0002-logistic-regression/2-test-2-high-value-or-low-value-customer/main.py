Problem Statement:
-------------------

This script demonstrates how to classify customers as either **High Value** or **Low Value** based on their historical data. The dataset contains features related to customer behavior and demographics.

We are using **Logistic Regression** to predict the customer value classification. The script will:

1. Load the customer data from a CSV file.
2. Split the data into training and testing datasets.
3. Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
4. Predict the customer classification (High Value = 1, Low Value = 0) using the trained model on test data.
5. Evaluate the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Visualize the distribution of the predicted values.
7. Predict the classification for a new customer based on their features.

Features used in the dataset:
- **Age**: Age of the customer (years).
- **Annual Income**: The income of the customer (in dollars).
- **Spending Score**: A score assigned based on the customer's spending habits (0-100).
- **Gender**: Whether the customer is Male or Female (encoded as 0 for Male and 1 for Female).
- **Number of Purchases**: Total number of purchases made by the customer in the past year.
  
### Dataset:
The dataset is available in the CSV file `customer_data.csv` and contains the following columns:
- **Age**: The age of the customer (numeric value).
- **Annual_Income**: The customer's income in dollars (numeric value).
- **Spending_Score**: A score representing customer spending habits (numeric value from 0 to 100).
- **Gender**: Coded as 0 for Male and 1 for Female (categorical).
- **Number_of_Purchases**: Total number of purchases made (numeric value).
- **Customer_Value**: The classification target variable. 0 for **Low Value** and 1 for **High Value** customer.

### Example:
Sample dataset (customer_data.csv):

| Age | Annual_Income | Spending_Score | Gender | Number_of_Purchases | Customer_Value |
|-----|---------------|----------------|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| 22  | 30000         | 50             | 1      | 10                   | 0              |
| 35  | 45000         | 60             | 0      | 20                   | 1              |
| 45  | 60000         | 30             | 0      | 15                   | 0              |
| 50  | 70000         | 80             | 1      | 25                   | 1              |
| 28  | 35000         | 55             | 1      | 12                   | 0              |

### Your Task:
1. Preprocess the data by handling any missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a **Logistic Regression** model to classify customers into **High Value** or **Low Value**.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Predict the classification for a new customer based on the following features:
   - Age = 30, Annual_Income = 45000, Spending_Score = 70, Gender = 0 (Male), Number_of_Purchases = 18

# Problem Statement:
# -------------------
# This script demonstrates how to classify animals as either a **Cat** or a **Dog** based on their physical attributes:
# - Weight (in kilograms)
# - Height (in centimeters)
#
# We are using **Logistic Regression** to classify animals. The script:
# 1. Loads animal data (Weight, Height) from a CSV file.
# 2. Splits the data into training and testing datasets.
# 3. Trains a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
# 4. Predicts the label (Cat = 0, Dog = 1) using the trained model on test data.
# 5. Evaluates model performance using accuracy.
# 6. Visualizes the decision boundary between Cats and Dogs.
# 7. Predicts the label for a new animal based on its weight and height.
#
# This example shows how a binary classification problem can be solved using **Logistic Regression** with two independent variables (Weight and Height) to predict a dependent variable (Cat or Dog).
