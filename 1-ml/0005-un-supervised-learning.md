# 🤖 Unsupervised Learning – Simple Explanation

## ✅ What is Unsupervised Learning?

In **unsupervised learning**, we give only **input data**.  
No correct answers (no labels) are given.

> The machine tries to **find patterns** or **group similar things** on its own.

---

## 🧠 Simple Example

You give a machine 1000 photos of animals.  
But you do **not** tell it which photo is dog, cat, or rabbit.

Machine looks at:

- Shape
- Size
- Color
- Other features

It **groups similar photos together**.

## 📘 Real-Life Example (Shopping Mall)

- Mall collects data of customers: age, shopping time, money spent.
- No labels are given.
- Mall uses unsupervised learning to group customers:
  - Group 1: Young students
  - Group 2: Families
  - Group 3: Old customers

## 🛠️ What does machine do?

- Finds **groups (clusters)** of similar data
- Finds **patterns**
- Reduces **high data into smaller parts** (dimensionality reduction)

## 📦 Types of Unsupervised Learning

### 1. 🎯 Clustering

- Grouping similar data
- Example:
  - Group customers based on buying habits
  - Group news articles based on topics

### 2. ✂️ Dimensionality Reduction

- Reduce number of features (columns) in big data
- Example:
  - Reduce 1000 features to 2 or 3 main features for easy viewing

## 🔍 Easy Way to Remember

| If you give labels (answers)? | Use: Supervised Learning   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| No labels (no answers)?       | Use: Unsupervised Learning |
