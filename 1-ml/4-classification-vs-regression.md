# 🎯 Classification vs Regression – Simple Explanation

In Supervised Learning, there are two types of problems:

- ✅ Classification
- 🔢 Regression

---

## ✅ What is Classification?

> Classification is used when the **output is a category or label**.

### 📘 Example Questions:

- Is this email spam or not?
- Is this a cat or a dog?
- Will it rain today? Yes or No?

### 🧠 Output:

- Categories like: "Yes"/"No", "Spam"/"Not Spam", "Dog"/"Cat"

### 🎯 Example Table:

| Features          | Output (Label)          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Email text        | "Spam" or "Not Spam"    |
| Animal image      | "Cat" or "Dog"          |
| Tumor size, shape | "Cancer" or "No Cancer" |

## 🔢 What is Regression?

> Regression is used when the **output is a number**.

### 📘 Example Questions:

- What is the price of this house?
- How many kilometers will the car run?
- What will be tomorrow’s temperature?

### 🧠 Output:

- Numbers like: 55.3, ₹1,20,000, 25°C

### 🎯 Example Table:

| Features               | Output (Number)  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| House size, location   | ₹75 lakhs        |
| Years of experience    | ₹8,00,000 salary |
| Day, weather, humidity | 32°C temperature |

| Feature            | Classification          | Regression              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Output Type        | Category/Label          | Number/Value            |
| Example Output     | "Yes", "No", "Cat"      | 123.4, ₹56,000, 98.6°C  |
| Use Cases          | Spam detection, disease | Price prediction, sales |
| Algorithm Examples | Logistic Regression,    | Linear Regression,      |
|                    | Decision Tree, KNN      | Decision Tree, SVR      |

## 🔍 Easy Way to Remember

| Clue             | Think Like This  |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| "What is it?"    | → Classification |
| "How much/many?" | → Regression     |

### Question: Predict student marks based on study hours.

- If you want to know:
  - **Exact marks** → This is **Regression**
  - **Pass or Fail** → This is **Classification**
