## ✅ Must-Know Algorithms

### 1. 📏 Linear Regression

- 🔸 Use: Predicting **numbers** (like price, marks, salary)
- 🔸 Example: Predict house price based on size
- 🔸 Output: Continuous value (like ₹5,000)

---

### 2. 🧾 Logistic Regression

- 🔸 Use: Predicting **Yes/No**, **True/False**
- 🔸 Example: Will customer buy or not?
- 🔸 Output: Probability (0 to 1), then convert to Yes/No

---

### 3. 🌳 Decision Tree

- 🔸 Use: Both classification and regression
- 🔸 Example: Is it a fruit? Yes → check color → check size → result
- 🔸 Works like **flowchart** with if-else conditions

---

### 4. 🌲 Random Forest

- 🔸 Many decision trees together (forest 🌳🌳🌳)
- 🔸 Gives better results than one tree
- 🔸 More accurate and strong

---

### 5. 🧠 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- 🔸 Finds best **line or boundary** to separate groups
- 🔸 Example: Separate good mangoes vs bad mangoes
- 🔸 Works well for small datasets with clear difference

---

### 6. 🧮 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- 🔸 Looks at **'K' closest neighbors** to make decision
- 🔸 Example: If your 5 nearest friends like tea, you might like it too!
- 🔸 Very simple and easy to understand

---

### 7. 🧠 Naive Bayes

- 🔸 Based on **probability**
- 🔸 Good for text data (like spam detection)
- 🔸 Fast and works well with large data
